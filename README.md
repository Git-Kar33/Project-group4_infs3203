## Project Title: EcoRewards 

**Introduction**

**Eco-Reward System**
Welcome to the Eco-Reward System, Qatar's innovative waste management solution! Our goal is to make waste collection efficient and rewarding for both residents and our dedicated collectors. 
Through this initiative, we're introducing a seamless way for collectors to gather users' waste while incentivizing eco-friendly behavior.

**How It Works**

This application will allow collectors to collect waste from the user which will be searched through user qatar id. Once the qatar id is identified or available in the database. It can proceed to collect reward which will added as points. 
This particular user will have separate page stating waste collected. If the id is not availble, this applicatin will directly create id and record the history of the collection for the waste.

**Reward Points**

Each selected item will be associated with a predefined number of points. For instance, selecting a plastic bottle might yield 3 points.

**Reward Distribution**

Users will accumulate points based on the waste collected from their designated ID. They can later redeem these points for rewards, such as monetary incentives.

**Benefits of Eco-Reward System**

Efficient Waste Collection: The application streamlines the waste collection process for our collectors, ensuring they can easily select and gather users' waste.

Sustainable motive: By rewarding users with points for their waste, we encourage responsible disposal practices and promote eco-friendly behavior.

Community Engagement: Through our rewards system, we aim to foster a sense of community involvement and responsibility towards waste management.
